# Space Shooter Game

This is a simple Space Shooter Game implemented in Python using tkinter for the GUI.

## Status

**Incomplete**: This project is still a work in progress. The current version provides basic functionality but lacks some features to make the GUI more playable and visually appealing.

- Player shooting (normal bullets)
- Enemy spawning and movement
- Collision detection for bullets hitting enemies
- Power-up dropping (with 10% chance)
- Basic game over condition

## To-Do

- Implement different types of enemies with varying behaviors
- Enhance player interaction with power-ups
- Improve GUI layout and responsiveness
- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement scoring system and level progression
- Refactor code for better readability and maintainability

## Usage

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed. Then, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
